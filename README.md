# Multi-Agent Economic Analysis System

A sophisticated economic analysis system that uses specialized AI agents to analyze inflation, GDP, and international trade data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. This system provides comprehensive economic insights through automated data collection, analysis, and visualization.

## 🎯 **System Overview**

This multi-agent system employs five specialized economic analysis agents:
- **🔴 Inflation Agent**: Monitors CPI, PCE, core inflation, and producer prices
- **🟢 GDP Agent**: Analyzes economic growth, business cycles, and productivity
- **🟠 Trade Agent**: Examines international trade flows, competitiveness, and trade balance
- **🔮 Forecast Agent**: Provides 12-month economic predictions using machine learning models
- **📊 Economic Cycle Agent**: Identifies business cycle phases and leading/lagging indicators

## 📊 **Recent Analysis Results**
